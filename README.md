# HacKnight

We're a hackathon running from June 1-2 at Buckingham Browne & Nichols school! Our website is hosted [here](https://hacknight.co/).

### HacKnight has two parts: The *Learnathon* and the *Hackathon*.
    
During the *Learnathon*, you can come to *workshops* hosted by BB&N students, learn new skills, and talk to guest speakers!

During the *Hackathon*, you can come build your own project and compete to *win prizes*!
You have the option to hack for 24 hours, (the overnight hackathon) or 9 (the day hackathon).
